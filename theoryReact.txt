-How to comment and uncomment components in react in code
-by creating folder
-imported component in app.jsx not gives error after commenting
-further topics hooks and pro
-we can uncomment topic and further sub-topic

-in app.jsx
   {
    <div>TopicIntro</div>
    }
-follow folder structure


-***JSX***
  -JavaScript and XML
  -JSX is html look like structure 
  -while writing JSX we need to follow some rules
  -Rules:
     -01)It is compulsory to return JSX (if not return JSX we will get blank page)               
     -02)We can't write multiple return statement.
          we can return only jsx  elements at a time.If we want to send multiple element it must be wrpped to single parent element 
     -03)Each and every tag in JSx must be closed
     -04)In html we have some repeated attributes
     -05)react fragment:used to avoid extra nodes /tags creation
         -two way of writing react fragments
           -way1:using angular braces
                -we can't use key which possible in other two ways of react fragment
           -way2:using react.fragment(how)
           -way3:using using fragment after destructuring from react by importing fragment from react(how)

           why we are writing fragment or react.fragment?-->we can use key attribute with any tag which is not possible empty tag

     -05)jsx expression rules
         -rules:
           -rule 1:we should not write console statements inside jsx XPathExpression because it will not displayed
           -rule2:in jsx expression we can't write any conditional statement except ternery operator and shortCircuit operators

 react npm vite vs react npx
 
-command
npx creat-react-app  "projecname"  (don't use camel case while naming project,Write always in lower case only)

(npm audit fix --npm :used to fix issues)


project opens at port ...
react :3000
react with vite:5173

folder structure of npx installation
-we will get index.html in public folder when we creat react project using react/
-app.js is present instead of app.jsx(in src folder)
   (in vite not allowed to write jsx code in js file. 
  but in react CRA js code can be written in js and jsx)

-difference between js and jsx in vite and reeact
-index.jx==main.jsx
-vite installation is 40x time faster also lesser in size

-npm run dev   vs  npm start      :commannds to run code for vite and react npx

-npm vs npx
  -npm :package installer(node package manager)
    -will compulsory download all the package and libraries in your sysytem
     means we are downloading the packages and then only we can use them
    -ANOLOGY:WAY1 OF USING FACEBOOK:it's like mobile app installation of facebook app
  -npx:(node package executer)
    -npx will download only the necessary packages and remaining packages we can access without downloading them
    -ANOLOGY:WAY2 OF USING FACEBOOK:downloading the browser ( nessessary packages)
      here in this example we are not downloading the facebook but indtead we are downloading the necessary package(browser)
      and executing/using facebook on that package

allP    necessaryP   allP    -->download packages 
600+    300-400      65-65
npm   vs npx   vs   npm vite
slower-------->faster

     -we can change name with default import
     -default vs named import
     -where to erite import,export,html code and js code wer to componenet
     -without curly braces returns object
     -import react ,{fragments} from "react";
       -ract and fragment
